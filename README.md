# Nitro starter
This is a test repo for what I believe is unexpected behavior in NitroJS.

## Routes to try:

- http://localhost:3000/foo.txt
- http://localhost:3000/bar.svg
- http://localhost:3000/baz.json
- http://localhost:3000/cat.jpg

Run an instance in dev mode side by side with one that's built (production) and note how the file type shifts between string and arraybuffer.
